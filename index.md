**[Amanda Lowe](mailto:amandalowe@aglowbelow.com)**<br/>
**Reflective Services**

I structure and facilitate **concentrated reflective processes** for spiritually oriented people from all walks of life.

The people I work with may find themselves experiencing stagnation, uncertainty, frustration, dissatisfaction, disillusionment, grief, and other similar feelings that indicate change and a need for growth. 

My clients know how to reflect in order to create a more satisfying situation for themselves and others. They have self-knowledge, maturity, and autonomy, and are looking for help that respects and expands their abilities. 

Together, we carefully discern your situation. We cultivate conditions that invite **effective and beautiful new insights and developments** to suggest themselves, take form, take root, and actualize.

We can focus on professional or personal concerns.

Sometimes the work is a short-term deep dive to address a particular issue; other times it is more comprehensive and time extended.

I only work with clients that I have a strong personal resonance with, and I bring my full effort, care, and attention to each client.

I expect a reciprocal commitment of energy and resources on my clients’ part.

Fees are negotiated on an individual basis and entail **a meaningful investment** for each client.

The first step is a free forty-five minute consultation in which we explore the possibilities for a working relationship and decide whether we wish to move forward.

If you feel drawn to work with me, [**please reach out when you feel the time is right**](mailto:amandalowe@aglowbelow.com).<br/>I look forward to hearing from you ❤️
