**[Amanda Lowe](mailto:amandalowe@aglowbelow.com)**<br/>
**Reflective Services**

I structure and facilitate concentrated reflective processes for spiritually oriented people from all walks of life. 

My clients are seeking help that respects their self-knowledge, maturity, and autonomy. 

Together, we carefully discern your situation. We cultivate conditions that invite **effective and beautiful new insights and developments** to suggest themselves, take form, take root, and actualize. 

Sometimes the work is a short-term deep dive to address a particular issue; other times it is more comprehensive and time extended.

We can focus on professional or personal concerns. 

I only work with clients that I have a strong personal resonance with, and I bring my full effort, care, and attention to each client.

I expect a reciprocal commitment of energy and resources on my clientsâ€™ part.

Fees are negotiated on an individual basis and entail **a meaningful investment** for each client. 

The first step is a free forty-five minute consultation in which we explore the possibilities for a working relationship and decide whether we wish to move forward.

If you feel drawn to work with me, [**please reach out when you feel the time is right**](mailto:amandalowe@aglowbelow.com).

I look forward to hearing from you <3
