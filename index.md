**[Amanda B. Lowe](mailto:amandalowe@aglowbelow.com)**<br/>
**Reflective Services**

My gift is helping people become more of who they truly are. I welcome people from all walks of life. 

My intention is to serve the visible and invisible communities of the Earth by supporting the psychospiritual development of those who would spread well-being, maturity, and wisdom to others. 

I structure and hold space for **a concentrated reflective process**. This entails the deep contemplation of some area of life where there is an interest or a concern calling for careful attention. 

My clients are spiritually oriented people who are skilled at encountering and working productively with surprising, ambiguous, or intense experiences. They use their own reflective processes as means of healing, growth, and development and are looking for support that respects their self-knowledge, maturity, and autonomy. They are usually between their late thirties and mid-sixties in age.

Together, we define a process that suits the issues at hand. 

Together, we create the conditions that invite **effective and beautiful new developments** to suggest themselves, take form, take root, and actualize.

My fee is tailored to each client’s economic situation. It is not cheap, because the work is not casual. I only work with clients that I have a strong personal resonance with, and I bring my full effort, care, and attention to each client. Regardless of the number of decimal places in a client’s bank account, the fee entails **a meaningful investment**. It is a reciprocal commitment of energy and resources on the client’s part. 

The first step is a free forty-five minute consultation in which we explore the possibilities for a working relationship and decide whether we wish to move forward. 

If you feel drawn to work with me, [please reach out when you feel the time is right](mailto:amandalowe@aglowbelow.com). 

I look forward to hearing from you <3
